                        Over Â£166 Billion was lent to SME businesses across the UK in 2018 according to Bank of England figures. In spite of
                        these encouraging numbers, many business owners still feel that access to getting business finance is becoming more
                        difficult.

                        of growth and stability, businesses need easy access to finance and multiple options to lower their costs.

                        <p>
